## Subsetting
- [] always returns object of same class as the original
- [[]] extracts elements of a list or a data frame; it can be used to extract a single element and the class of the returned object will not necessarily e a list or data frame
- $ extracts elements of a list or data frame by name
```{r}
x <- c("a", "b", "c", "c", "d", "a")
x[1] # subset the first element
x[2] # subset 2nd elem
x[1:4] # subset elements w/ indices 1 through 4

x[x > 'a'] # subset w/ elements greater than a

u <- x > 'a'
u
x[u] # subset with a logical vector
```
