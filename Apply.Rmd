```{r}
x <- matrix(rnorm(200), 20, 10)
apply(x, 2, mean) # vector of length 10 with mean of all columns; 2 refers to column - rows got eliminated

apply(x, 1, sum) # vector of length 20, columns got eliminated; 1 refers to rows

x <- matrix(rnorm(200), 20, 10)
apply(x, 1, quantile, probs = c(0.25, 0.75))
