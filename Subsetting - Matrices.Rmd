## Subsetting Matrices
```{r}
x <- matrix(1:6, 2, 3)
x[1,2] # r = 1, c = 2
x[2,1]

x[1, ] # get all elements from 1st row
x[, 2] # get all elements from 2nd col
```

- when a single element is retrieved || row || col, it is returned as VECTOR of length 1 rather than a 1 by 1 matrix
- behavior turned off by drop = FALSE

```{r}
x <- matrix(1:6, 2, 3)
x[1,2] # returns a vector
x[1,2, drop = FALSE] # returns a 1 by 1 matrix

x[1, ]
x[1, , drop = FALSE]
```
