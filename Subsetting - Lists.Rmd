## Subsetting lists

```{r}
x <- list(foo = 1:4, bar = .6)
x[1] # returns a list w/ name 'foo' w/ seq 1:4
x[[1]] # returns that element of the list, which is a seq of 1:4
x$bar # extracts elements by the name of 'bar'
x[["bar"]] # should also work the same
x["bar"]
```

## Extracting multiple elements
```{r}
# can only use the [], the others don't work
x <- list(foo = 1:4, bar = .6, baz = "hello")
x[c(1,3)]
```

## using the [[]] vs $
- [[]] can be used with computed indices
- $ can only be used with literal names
```{r}
x <- list(foo = 1:4, bar = .5, baz = 'hello')
name <- 'foo'
x[[name]] # computed index for 'foo'
x$name # element 'name' does not exist
x$foo
```

## Subsetting Nested Elements of a List
```{r}
x <- list(a = list(10,12,14), b = c(3.14,2.81))
x[[c(1,3)]] # returns 3rd elem of 1st elem
x[[1]][[3]] # achieves same goal
x[[c(2,1)]]
```
